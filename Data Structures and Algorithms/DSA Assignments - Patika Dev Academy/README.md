# Data Structures and Algorithms | Patika.dev Academy

I used the [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) application while doing my first assignment for [Patika Academy](https://academy.patika.dev/) and benefited from the information on this [link](http://ikucukkoc.baun.edu.tr/lectures/EMT2226/EMT2226W14.pdf).
I also used the [Microsoft Whiteboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-whiteboard/digital-whiteboard-app/) application for other assignments.
